      "You are a wanderer in medieval times, taking a shortcut between towns through a scarcely populated area. The sun is setting, and the shadows grow longer. The wind whispers through the trees, and you feel a chill run down your spine. It's getting dark, and you need shelter for the night.",
      "As you trudge along the path, a faint glow catches your eye. It's a torch flickering by the front door of an old, decrepit inn. The building looks like it has seen better days, but it's your only option. You push the creaky door open and step inside. Behind a dusty reception desk stands an old, creepy-looking man with a crooked smile. 'Welcome, traveler,' he says. 'The inn is full tonight, but you're welcome to stay for a meal.'",
      "You sit at a rickety table and eat a simple meal of bread and stew. The innkeeper watches you silently, his eyes gleaming in the dim light. When you finish, he says, 'I'll be retiring for the night. Feel free to rest here.' He shuffles away, leaving you alone in the eerie silence. Something feels off. The inn is too quiet. You decide to investigate and head upstairs to a corridor with five guest rooms.",
      "The corridor is dimly lit by a single flickering candle. The air is heavy, and you feel an inexplicable urge to knock on one of the doors. You approach the first door and knock gently. A low, eerie voice responds, 'Who is there?' You answer, 'I'm just a wanderer...' The voice replies, 'But do you know who I am?'",
      "You knock on the second door. Again, the eerie voice asks, 'Who is there?' You reply, 'I'm just a wanderer...' The voice says, 'But do you know who I am?'",
      "You approach the third door and knock. The same eerie voice asks, 'Who is there?' You answer, 'I'm just a wanderer...' The voice replies, 'But do you know who I am?'",
      "The fourth door creaks as you knock. The voice asks, 'Who is there?' You respond, 'I'm just a wanderer...' The voice says, 'But do you know who I am?'",
      "You reach the fifth and final door. You knock, and the voice asks, 'Who is there?' You reply, 'I'm just a wanderer...' The voice says, 'But do you know who I am?'",
      "With all the monsters correctly guessed, they leave their rooms and head downstairs to the bar. You follow them, feeling a mix of curiosity and unease. The innkeeper is already there, serving food and drink. The monsters sit together, chatting and laughing as if they were old friends. You join them, but the atmosphere is surreal.",
      "As the night wears on, you grow increasingly sleepy. The innkeeper offers you a drink, and you accept. The last thing you remember is the sound of laughter and the flickering candlelight. When you wake up, it's dawn, and you're alone in the inn. The monsters are gone, and the innkeeper is nowhere to be seen. You wonder if it was all a dream...",
    

  // New events (10-19)
  "As the wanderer leaves the inn at dawn, they notice the building begins to fade into the mist, as if it never existed. They pause, staring at the spot where the inn once stood, and wonder if it was all a dream. The morning sun casts long shadows, and the wanderer feels a strange sense of unease.",
  "The wanderer finds a small, intricately carved token in their pocket—a symbol of the inn. They have no memory of receiving it, but it radiates a faint, otherworldly energy. The token feels warm to the touch, and the wanderer senses that it holds some significance.",
  "The wanderer hears the innkeeper’s voice echoing in their mind: 'Beware the crossroads at midnight. The monsters are not confined to the inn.' The voice fades, leaving the wanderer with a chilling sense of foreboding. They clutch the token tightly, wondering what lies ahead.",
  "The wanderer encounters a traveling merchant on the road. The merchant’s cart is filled with strange trinkets and artifacts. When the wanderer shows the token, the merchant’s eyes widen. 'That symbol... it belongs to the Cursed Inn,' the merchant says. 'If you seek answers, go to the village of Hollowbrook. But beware—the road is treacherous.'",
  "The wanderer arrives at the village of Hollowbrook, only to find it eerily deserted. The streets are empty, and the windows of the houses are dark. A cold wind blows through the village, carrying with it the faint sound of whispers. The wanderer feels as though they are being watched.",
  "The wanderer learns from an old villager that the monsters from the inn were once humans cursed by a powerful sorcerer. 'The curse binds them to the inn,' the villager explains. 'But the sorcerer’s grimoire holds the key to breaking it. It is hidden deep within the Forest of Whispers.'",
  "A cryptic riddle leads the wanderer to the Forest of Whispers, where the grimoire is said to be hidden. The forest is dark and foreboding, with twisted trees and an unnatural silence. The wanderer feels a presence lurking in the shadows, watching their every move.",
  "In the forest, the wanderer encounters one of the monsters from the inn, now in human form. 'The curse weakens outside the inn,' the former monster explains. 'But we are bound to return every full moon. If you find the grimoire, you can free us—but the sorcerer’s seal must be broken first.'",
  "The wanderer discovers that the sorcerer who created the curse is still alive, imprisoned in a magical seal deep within the forest. The seal is guarded by spectral creatures tied to the curse. The wanderer must decide whether to free the sorcerer or leave the seal intact.",
  "The wanderer stands before the grimoire, its pages glowing with dark energy. They must decide: destroy the grimoire and banish the inn forever, or use its power to break the curse, risking their own soul in the process. The weight of the decision hangs heavy in the air."
